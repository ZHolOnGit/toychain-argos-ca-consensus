# Robot swarms need blockchain technology: A comparison of consensus protocols and their resilience to Byzantine robots

## Data
The zip file contains the raw data of the following experiments:

- Experiment 1: Random distribution (no Byzantines)
- Experiment 2: Random distribution
- Experiment 3: Consensus
- Experiment 4: Binary distribution
- Experiment 5: Sybil attack

We compare the three approaches:

- Approach 1: Linear consensus
- Approach 2: W-MSR
- Approach 3: Blockchain

There is one file per experiment and approach. The filename is
composed of the experiment number, experiment name, and used approach:
`<experiment_number>_<experiment_name>_<approach>.csv`. For example
`2_Threshold_1` corresponds to Experiment 2 - Byzantine conducted with
the linear consensus protocol.
